Where the idea for the (small but effective) script comes from:

    I wanted to check for more content on a photography website - fast and thoroughly. Yet:

    1. By searching the website manually I would have possibly lost out on unlisted content. 

    2. Copy and pasting all (> 100) sitemap URLs manually would have been too annoying.

    Ta-da: This script does the job. Like a machine. (With a few extras.)


Optional (Mac only): 

    Use the Automator workflow to download the images in your "currently-open-website" when using Safari.

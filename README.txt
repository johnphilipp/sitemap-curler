\f0\fs24 \cf0 Where the idea for the (small but effective) script comes from:\
\
I wanted to check for more content on a photography website - fast and thoroughly. Yet:\
\
1. By searching the website manually I would have possibly lost out on unlisted content. \
\
2. Copy and pasting all (> 100) sitemap URLs would have been too annoying.\
\
Ta-da: The script does the job. Like a machine. (With a few extras.)}
